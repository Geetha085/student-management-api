# Student Management REST API

A backend REST API built using **Python** and **Django REST Framework** to manage student records.  
This project demonstrates practical implementation of **RESTful APIs**, **HTTP methods**, **JSON request/response handling**, and **client–server architecture**.

This project is designed as a beginner-to-intermediate backend project and is suitable for showcasing on GitHub and resumes.

## 📌 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to build a backend service that allows clients to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data using REST principles.

The API follows a clean and standard RESTful design and communicates using JSON format.
